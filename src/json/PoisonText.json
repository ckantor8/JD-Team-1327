      "body": "- Keep medicines in their original containers. People can often lose track medicine if they switch the container it is in which can lead to the accidental ingestion of medicine. \n- Keep medicines and other dangerous substances at a height above eye level for children. Children will often grab anything that appeals to them, so keeping potentially harmful substances out of their range of view will prevent them from attempting to consume them. \n- Secure child safety locks on things such as medicines. In the case that a child is able to grab a bottle of medicine, the child safety lock will prevent them from accessing the pills inside."

      "title": "2. Be aware of potentially dangerous materials being left around children",
      "body": "- Put away all potential hazardous materials right after use to ensure a child does not have time to take themselves. A large portion of poisonings occur due to parents or caretakers being careless and unaware of the dangerous things left around their children. Being more careful about putting things such as cosmetics, plastics, and cleaning supplies could help prevent children from consuming potent items."

      "title": "3. Ensure that you are familiar with all potential dangers both inside and outside the home",
      "body": "- Make sure all natural gas based appliances are functioning correctly. As more of a general safety tip, ensuring that these appliances are functioning correctly will reduce the chance of poisonings for both children and adults. \n- Ensure that you have functioning carbon monoxide and smoke detectors. These are critical because both of these can detect hazards that occur silently. \n- Memorize the poison help number (1-800-222-1222). This 24/7 line can connect you to an expert in the case that you suspect a child has been poisoned. \n- Familiarize yourself with the plants in and outside of your home, especially if you live near plants that produce bright or noticeable berries that could be poisonous. Children will be attracted to plants that look appealing, such as holly and juniper berries. Canvas the outside of your home or ask a professional to make sure that you are familiar with all the plant species in the vicinity of your home. Remove or relocate any poisonous plants to ensure your child does not consume its berries. \n- Check your home for lead paint that can chip off. Lead poisoning can be difficult to detect, and so either get an expert of check yourself to see if your home contains this kind of paint. Lead paint and dust is more common among older buildings, so be sure to check if your home fits this criteria."
