      "title": "\nThings to avoid when shopping for carseats",
      "body": "\tNever use a carseat that is too old. The manufacturer will make a note of how long the carseat can be used and when it was made. If a carseat has any visible cracks on it, it is unuseable and can cause more harm than good to your child. Carseats should also be replaced after any moderate or severe crash. Even minor crashes can cause unseen damage to the carseat and may need replacing. Carseats can also be recalled; make sure that you hold on to the manufacturer label for the carseat so that you know the age of the seat and if it has been recalled. If in doubt, you can call the manufacturer or contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Vehicle Safety Hotline at (888)-327-4236 or their website. Lastly, follow manufacturer directions for cleaning car seats. Cleaning but not disinfecting is usually permitted. That's because disinfectant products may decrease the protection provided by the seat and harness."

      "body": "\tMake sure that everyone who transports your child uses the correct car safety seat or seat belt on every trip, every time. Being consistent with car safety seat use is good parenting, reduces fussing and complaints, and is safest for your child. Never leave your child alone in or around cars, and lock your vehicle when it is not in use. A child can die of heatstroke because temperatures can reach deadly levels in minutes. A child can be strangled by power windows, retracting seat belts, sunroofs, or accessories. A child can knock the vehicle into gear, setting it into motion. A child can be backed over when the vehicle backs up. A child can be trapped in the trunk of the vehicle."
