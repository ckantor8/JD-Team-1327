Place it on the floor so that the child cannot rock itself off or be pulled/pushed by other siblings. \n- Try to use shopping carts with wheeled carriers attached whenever possible as they protect the child and often have fun designs \n- If you are using a normal shopping cart and seat, always use the harnesses or safety belts and avoid carts without them \n- Even if you are using a cart with an attached carrier, never leave your child alone in the cart or allow them to ride in, under, or on the cart basket.

Though be mindful that children may grow strong enough to open the bottom \n- When not in use, never forget to not only close but LOCK windows. \n- Normal screens are not meant for protection, so install proper window guards that you can easily open in the event of an emergency. \n- For extra protection, install window stops that prevent them from opening more than a few inches.

      "body": "\tFalls are the leading cause of hospitalized injury in the U.S. for children ages 0 to 14. [1] In fact, over 2 million children ages 14 and under are estimated to receive treatment for fall injuries annually. [2] Though these injuries are even more prevalent and severe for younger age groups. According to the CDC, falls are the leading cause of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) for children ages 0 to 4 with over 50% of total nonfatal injuries to infants under one being attributed to falls.

Infants are most likely to fall from furniture/toys and stairs while they are unable to walk, while toddlers and older children are more likely to fall on the playground or from windows. [2]"

      "title": "Stroller Safety",
      "body": "\tJust like you need to stay mindful when children are secured in carriers, you also need to remain aware when your child is in a stroller. You should always use the safety harnesses and even then, always use the brakes when not in motion and NEVER leave your child alone in a stroller. To avoid trapping their head or wrapping up their neck, close all openings and never hang bags on the handles (this could tip the stroller). If your child has too much room, use tightly rolled baby blankets instead of a pillow or large blanket. Lastly, fold and unfold strollers away from children to avoid pinching any fingers. Here are some tips when it comes to purchasing a stroller: \n- Make sure the stroller is designed for the height, weight, and age of your child (infants need to lie almost flat) \n- Check for reliable and, ideally, 5-point safety harnesses / restraining belts (shoulders, waist, between the legs) \n- Look for dual brakes that use wheel mechanism rather than pressure on the tire and, most importantly, are easy to use \n- Avoid parts that can pinch fingers or trap the head of a child \n- A safe and stable stroller should have a wide wheel base, a seat low in the frame, small leg openings, waist-level (or a bit lower) handlebars, and resist tipping backward when pressing the handles [7]"
