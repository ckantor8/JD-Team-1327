      "title": "\nWhy is preventing burn injuries important?",
      "body": "\tMany regular household items like outlets, food, and hot water can cause childhood burns. Burn injuries can occur from flames or electrical current but the most concerning for children is scald burns from hot water [1]. About 20,000 children under the age of 4 are hospitalized for scald injuries annually [2]. Studies show that nearly 75% of these burn injuries are preventable so understanding safety procedures is essential [3]. Infants and younger children are at higher risk of heat and cold injuries as well, since they produce and lose heat faster than adults [4]. Even though burns are the fifth most common cause of accidental death for children, many of the deaths are preventable [4]. Since most burn injuries happen at home, there are a lot of prevention measures that can be taken."

      "title": "Types of burn injuries?",
      "body": "\tThere are a few different types of burn injuries. The most common are thermal burns which are caused when heat sources drastically raise the temperature of skin and tissue. Electrical burns due to contact with electricity are also relatively common. It’s easy to overlook, but radiation burns from prolonged exposure to the sun can also injure children. It’s also important to be cognizant of friction burns which can occur if children are playing with ropes."

      "title": "What are Treatment Options?",
      "body": "\tIn the unfortunate case of a burn injury, some treatments may help. It’s crucial to cool the affected area with cold water or a cold compress. Protect the burned area by wrapping it with gauze or cloth while not breaking any blisters. Don’t immediately apply any ointments, oils, or sprays. If you fear the injury is severe enough or covers a large area, call emergency medical services. If an electrical burn occurs, then there may be damage below the skin so seeing a doctor is also necessary [4]."
