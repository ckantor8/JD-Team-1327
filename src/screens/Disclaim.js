      <Text allowFontScaling={true} style={CoreStyle.about}>{'\t'}This application was developed in 2022 for Dr. Ann McClellan
      by a team of five students studying Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
      Initially, it was built around the standalone game created by the original team, Team BeDot.
      But we have worked incredibly hard on expanding this application and we all hope that the valuable information presented
      can help new parents and other caregivers prevent some of the unnecessary injuries and deaths caused by child accidents. {'\n'}
